_**User**_

Can we make a new branch to fix Public stats not consistent on main page, they show 0 and sometimes the right amount. In localhost they appear perfectly, but on prod (churnistic.com) they stay at 0 and sometimes correctly. 

How can we make sure this is 100% consistent and fixed?
Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions before we move onto implementing the actual code fix

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user wants me to help diagnose an issue with public stats not showing consistently on the main page - sometimes they show 0, sometimes they show the correct amount. The issue only appears in production (churnistic.com) and not on localhost.

Let me break down my approach:
1. I'll need to explore the codebase to understand how the stats are handled
2. Come up with 5-7 potential sources of the problem
3. Narrow down to 1-2 most likely sources
4. Add logging to validate assumptions
5. Eventually implement a fix (though that will be in a later step)

First, I should create a new branch for this work.

Then I need to understand the codebase structure to locate the relevant files. I'll start by exploring the repository to get familiar with its organization.</think>I'll help you diagnose and fix the inconsistent public stats issue on the main page. Let's start by creating a new branch for this work.

---

```bash
git checkout -b fix-inconsistent-public-stats
```

```
➜  churnistic git:(develop) ✗ git checkout -b fix-inconsistent-public-stats
Switched to a new branch 'fix-inconsistent-public-stats'
?➜  churnistic git:(develop) ?✗
```

Now let's explore the codebase to understand how the public stats are implemented. First, let's look at the project structure to get a better understanding of the codebase organization.

This looks like a Next.js application with Firebase integration. Let's explore the source code to find the components related to the public stats.

Let's look at the app directory which should contain the main page where the public stats are displayed:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src/app • **18** results</summary>

Let's check the main page file where the public stats might be displayed:

---

Read file: src/app/page.tsx

---

Let's continue reading the file to see how the stats are loaded and displayed:

---

Read file: src/app/page.tsx

---

Let's check the `useSplashStats` hook that seems to be fetching the stats:

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "useSplashStats" • **1** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |

</details>

---

Let's read the useSplashStats hook:

---

Read file: src/lib/hooks/useSplashStats.ts

---

Now let's check how the API endpoint for public stats is implemented:

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "api/opportunities/public-stats" • **1** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |

</details>

---

Let's read the API route implementation:

---

Read file: src/app/api/opportunities/public-stats/route.ts

---

Let's also check how the stats are displayed on the main page:

---

Read file: src/app/page.tsx

---

Now, let's look for where the HeroSection component uses the stats:

---

Read file: src/app/page.tsx

---

Let's also look at the actual HeroSection to see how it displays the stats:

---

Read file: src/app/page.tsx

---

Let's continue the HeroSection component to see where the stats are displayed:

---

Read file: src/app/page.tsx

---

Let's see how each stat is rendered:

---

Read file: src/app/page.tsx

Based on this exploration, I now have a good understanding of how the public stats are implemented. Let me analyze the potential sources of the problem where stats are sometimes shown as 0 in production but work fine locally.

Here are 5-7 possible sources of the problem:

1. **Firebase Initialization Timing Issue**: In the `public-stats/route.ts` file, there's a check to see if Firebase is initialized. If it's not initialized yet when the API is called, it returns default values (all 0). It's possible that in production, the timing of Firebase initialization is different, causing this check to sometimes fail.

2. **Caching Issues**: The API route has caching headers (`'Cache-Control': 'public, s-maxage=300, stale-while-revalidate=60'`). This could be causing stale data to be served sometimes, and the caching behavior might be different in production vs. local development.

3. **Query Timeout Issue**: The API has a 5-second timeout. If Firestore queries are slower in production than locally, they could be timing out occasionally, resulting in default values being returned.

4. **React Query Cache Behavior**: The `useSplashStats` hook uses react-query with specific caching settings (staleTime, gcTime). There could be issues with how react-query is managing the cache in production.

5. **Firestore Permissions**: It's possible that there are occasional permission issues with Firestore in production that don't occur locally, causing queries to fail.

6. **Network Latency/Reliability**: In production, network requests to Firestore might occasionally fail or be unreliable due to latency or connectivity issues.

7. **Firebase Admin Credential Issues**: The Firebase admin initialization uses credentials from environment variables. If there's an issue with these credentials in production (perhaps they're occasionally unavailable or invalid), it could cause Firebase initialization to fail.

Based on these possibilities, the most likely sources of the problem are:

1. **Firebase Initialization Timing Issue**: This is most likely because the code explicitly returns zeros when Firebase isn't initialized. The check `if (getApps().length === 0)` could sometimes evaluate to true in production due to timing differences.

2. **Caching Issues**: Given that you see inconsistent behavior (sometimes 0, sometimes correct), this strongly suggests a caching problem where stale data is being served.

Let's add logging to validate these assumptions. I'll add logs to the API route to track:
1. Whether Firebase is initialized
2. What data is being returned
3. Timing information
