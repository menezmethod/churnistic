# Inline Editing Fix: Summary and Implementation Guide

## Issue Summary

When submitting inline edits, sections of content are being unexpectedly deleted. After thorough code analysis, we've identified several root causes:

1. **Improper Optimistic Updates**: The current implementation directly replaces the entire cached object instead of properly merging the changes, causing some nested fields to be lost.

2. **Insufficient Nested Object Handling**: The way nested objects are constructed and processed during updates doesn't maintain the complete data structure.

3. **State Management Issues**: The interplay between local component state and global state through React Query might be causing inconsistencies.

## Key Files Involved

1. `src/app/opportunities/[id]/hooks/useEditMode.ts` - Core update logic for inline editing
2. `src/lib/hooks/useUpdateOpportunity.ts` - React Query mutation handling
3. `src/app/api/opportunities/[id]/route.ts` - Server-side update handling
4. `src/app/opportunities/[id]/components/EditableField.tsx` - UI component for inline editing

## Key Implementation Steps

### 1. Fix Optimistic Updates in useEditMode.ts

The most critical fix is to update the optimistic update in `useEditMode.ts` to use a proper deep merge:

```typescript
// Modify this section in useEditMode.ts
queryClient.setQueryData(
  opportunityKeys.detail(opportunity.id),
  (oldData) => {
    if (!oldData) return updatedOpportunity;
    // Deep merge to preserve all nested fields
    return merge({}, oldData, updatedOpportunity);
  }
);
```

### 2. Ensure Consistent Data Structure in API Updates

Modify the way updates are constructed to ensure nested objects are properly handled:

```typescript
// In useEditMode.ts - enhance the update data construction
// After creating the nested object structure for the field update
// Add any additional metadata or required fields

// Ensure metadata is always included
updateData.metadata = {
  ...opportunity.metadata,
  updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
};

// Add logging to track what's being sent
console.log('Generated update data:', updateData);
```

### 3. Add Deep Merge Utility and Standardize Its Use

Create or use a deep merge utility across all update operations:

```typescript
// src/utils/objectUtils.ts
import { merge } from 'lodash';

export function deepMerge<T>(target: T, ...sources: Partial<T>[]): T {
  return merge({}, target, ...sources);
}
```

### 4. Add Strategic Debugging

Add logging at key points to track data flow:

- Before and after optimistic updates
- In the API route handler
- During form submission in the EditableField component

## Implementation Checklist

1. [ ] Fix optimistic updates in useEditMode.ts
2. [ ] Fix optimistic updates in useUpdateOpportunity.ts  
3. [ ] Improve server-side handling of nested objects
4. [ ] Add debugging logs to track data flow
5. [ ] Create helper utilities for working with nested data
6. [ ] Add error handling to the EditableField component
7. [ ] Test all field types after implementing fixes
8. [ ] Verify that no data is lost during updates

## Testing Strategy

1. **Manual Testing**: Test editing different field types, especially nested fields
2. **Console Logging**: Use the added debugging logs to verify data consistency
3. **React Query DevTools**: Monitor cache state before and after updates
4. **Integration Tests**: Use the provided testInlineEditing utility function

## Additional Considerations

- **Performance Impact**: The deep merge operations might have a slight performance impact, but the data integrity gain outweighs this concern.
- **Error Handling**: Consider adding more robust error handling and UI feedback during editing operations.
- **Optimistic UI**: The current approach uses optimistic updates; consider if this is still the right approach or if you need more safeguards.
