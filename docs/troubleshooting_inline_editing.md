# Troubleshooting Guide: Components Still Disappearing After Inline Editing

This guide addresses the persistent issue where components or data sections are still disappearing after implementing the initial fixes for inline editing.

## The Root Issue We Fixed

After analyzing the logs, we found the root issue: **objects in the update data were replacing entire objects in the database instead of being properly merged with existing data**.

Specifically, when updating a field like `details.monthly_fees.amount`, the entire `details` object was being replaced with just `{ monthly_fees: { amount: '6' } }`, causing all other fields within `details` to disappear.

We've addressed this issue with several key fixes:

1. Improved the API endpoint to correctly merge updates with existing data
2. Enhanced the object utilities to handle deep merging properly
3. Added better optimistic updates in React Query
4. Implemented extensive debugging to track data flow

## If You're Still Seeing Issues, Check The Following:

### Step 1: Verify the fixes are working

After implementing our fixes, your logs should show:

- Proper deep merging in the API route
- Full preservation of object structures
- Detailed debugging information throughout the update process

The console logs should show messages like:

- "Deep merging existing data for key"
- "Merged update data for opportunity"
- "Details object key comparison"

### Step 2: Check for specific edge cases

If you're still having issues with specific fields, check:

1. **Arrays**: Arrays are handled differently than objects. If you're losing array data, you may need special handling:

```typescript
// Special handling for arrays in mergeObjectsRecursive function
if (Array.isArray(sourceValue)) {
  // Either replace the array or merge it depending on your needs
  result[key] = sourceValue; // Replace approach
  // OR for merging arrays:
  // result[key] = [...targetClone[key] as unknown[], ...sourceValue];
}
```

2. **Deeply nested paths**: Very deep nesting might exceed recursion limits. Check if your disappearing data is at a deep nesting level.

3. **Special field types**: Some fields might need custom handling (e.g., date objects, complex data structures).

### Step 3: Monitor field updates in real-time

We've added comprehensive logging throughout the update process. When editing a field:

1. Open your browser's developer console
2. Look for the following log sequence:
   - Initial field update in useEditMode
   - Optimistic cache update with merge results
   - API request with update data
   - Server processing logs
   - Response with updated data
   - Cache invalidation and refresh

If any step is missing expected data, that's where to focus your debugging.

### Step 4: Try these additional fixes if needed

If you're still having issues:

1. **Add custom serialization/deserialization**: Some complex objects might need custom handling before being sent to the API.

2. **Implement a more aggressive merge strategy**: Update the `mergeObjectsRecursive` function to always keep all fields from the target object:

```typescript
function mergeObjectsRecursive(target, source) {
  // Start with a deep clone of the target
  const result = cloneDeep(target);

  // Then carefully update only the specific fields from source
  for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(source)) {
    if (value === null) {
      // Explicitly preserve null values from source
      result[key] = null;
    } else if (typeof value === 'object' && !Array.isArray(value)) {
      // For objects, recursively merge
      result[key] =
        result[key] && typeof result[key] === 'object' && !Array.isArray(result[key])
          ? mergeObjectsRecursive(result[key], value)
          : cloneDeep(value);
    } else {
      // For primitives and arrays, use the source value
      result[key] = cloneDeep(value);
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```

3. **Consider adding a field preserving validation step**: Before applying updates, verify that all expected fields are present and add them back if missing.

## Testing Your Fix

To verify the issue is fully resolved:

1. Edit a field within a complex nested object (like `details.monthly_fees.amount`)
2. Check that the entire `details` object is preserved in the response
3. Reload the page and verify all data is still present
4. Try editing other fields to ensure consistent behavior

Our comprehensive fixes should resolve the issue of disappearing components during inline editing. If you're still experiencing problems, review the logs carefully and focus on the specific steps where data might be getting lost.
