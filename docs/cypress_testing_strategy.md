## 2. Key Test Scenarios

### Authentication
- Successful login/logout
- Invalid credential handling
- Password recovery flow
- Session management

### Opportunities
- CRUD operations
- Real-time updates
- Data validation
- AI integration

### Dashboard
- Data visualization
- Filtering and sorting
- Responsive behavior
- Performance metrics

## 3. Error Handling Mechanisms
- Custom Cypress commands for common assertions
- Automatic retries for flaky tests
- Network error simulation
- Error state validation

## 4. CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Parallel test execution
- Test result reporting
- Slack notifications

## 5. Reporting and Debugging
- HTML test reports
- Screenshots on failure
- Video recordings
- Console logging

## 6. Maintenance Strategy
- Regular test reviews
- Code quality checks
- Test data management
- Dependency updates

## 7. Performance Optimization
- API response mocking
- Network throttling
- Resource monitoring
- Test parallelization

## 8. Visual Regression Testing
- Percy integration
- Baseline image management
- Visual diff analysis
- Responsive testing

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (0-2 weeks)
- Setup Cypress environment
- Implement authentication tests
- Configure CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Coverage (2-6 weeks)
- Add opportunity management tests
- Implement dashboard tests
- Setup visual regression testing

### Phase 3: Optimization (6-8 weeks)
- Parallel test execution
- Performance optimization
- Advanced reporting

## Best Practices
- Modular test design
- Data-driven testing
- Atomic test cases
- Regular code reviews
- Continuous improvement
