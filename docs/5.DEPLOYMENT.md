# Deployment Strategy

## Overview

Churnistic follows a robust deployment strategy ensuring reliability, security, and continuous delivery.

### Deployment Pipeline

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Development"
        D[Developer Push] --> B[Build]
        B --> T[Test]
        T --> V[Validate]
    end

    subgraph "Staging"
        V --> S[Stage]
        S --> AT[Acceptance Tests]
        AT --> PA[Performance Analysis]
    end

    subgraph "Production"
        PA --> DP[Deploy]
        DP --> M[Monitor]
        M --> R[Rollback if needed]
    end
```

## Environment Strategy

### 1. Development

- Local development setup
- Feature branch deployments
- Integration testing
- Performance profiling

### 2. Staging

- Production-like environment
- Full integration testing
- Load testing
- User acceptance testing

### 3. Production

- Blue-green deployment
- Canary releases
- Auto-scaling
- High availability

## Infrastructure Management

### Cloud Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Edge Layer"
        CDN[CDN]
        WAF[WAF]
    end

    subgraph "Application Layer"
        LB[Load Balancer]
        APP1[App Server 1]
        APP2[App Server 2]
        APP3[App Server 3]
    end

    subgraph "Data Layer"
        DB1[(Primary DB)]
        DB2[(Replica DB)]
        CACHE[Cache]
    end

    CDN --> WAF
    WAF --> LB
    LB --> APP1
    LB --> APP2
    LB --> APP3
    APP1 --> DB1
    APP2 --> DB1
    APP3 --> DB1
    DB1 --> DB2
    APP1 --> CACHE
    APP2 --> CACHE
    APP3 --> CACHE
```

### Infrastructure as Code

- Terraform configurations
- AWS CloudFormation
- Docker containers
- Kubernetes orchestration

## Release Process

### Release Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant CI as CI/CD
    participant QA as QA Team
    participant Ops as Operations
    participant Prod as Production

    Dev->>CI: Push Code
    CI->>CI: Build & Test
    CI->>QA: Deploy to Staging
    QA->>QA: Run Tests
    QA->>Ops: Approve Release
    Ops->>Prod: Deploy
    Note over Ops,Prod: Monitor Deployment
    alt Deployment Issues
        Prod->>Ops: Alert Issues
        Ops->>Prod: Rollback
    end
```

### 1. Preparation

- Version tagging
- Change documentation
- Dependency updates
- Security checks

### 2. Deployment

- Zero-downtime updates
- Database migrations
- Cache warming
- Health checks

### 3. Verification

- Smoke tests
- Integration checks
- Performance monitoring
- User feedback

## Monitoring & Alerts

### System Health

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Monitoring"
        M1[System Metrics]
        M2[Application Logs]
        M3[User Analytics]
        M4[Error Tracking]
    end

    subgraph "Alerting"
        A1[Critical Alerts]
        A2[Warning Alerts]
        A3[Info Alerts]
    end

    subgraph "Response"
        R1[Auto-scaling]
        R2[Error Resolution]
        R3[Performance Tuning]
    end

    M1 --> A1
    M1 --> A2
    M2 --> A1
    M2 --> A3
    M3 --> A2
    M4 --> A1

    A1 --> R1
    A1 --> R2
    A2 --> R3
```
