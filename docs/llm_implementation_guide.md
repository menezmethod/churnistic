# Document-Level LLM Implementation Guide

## 1. Avoiding the Oversized Build

### 1.1 Lean Development

- Start with core functionality only
- Use explicit prompts to limit scope
- Example: "Generate only login flow and basic content display"

### 1.2 Modular Architecture

- Isolate features into independent modules
- Use clear interfaces between components
- Maintain separation of concerns

### 1.3 Phased Development

- Focus on MVP first
- Gather user feedback early
- Add features incrementally

## 2. Preventing the Fix-and-Fail Loop

### 2.1 Test-Driven Development

- Write tests before implementation
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage
- Use automated testing pipelines

### 2.2 Change Management

- Require explanations for all changes
- Review code diffs carefully
- Use version control effectively

### 2.3 Debugging Strategy

- Use multiple LLMs for verification
- Analyze root causes before fixing
- Maintain error logs and metrics

## 3. Ensuring Proper Deployment

### 3.1 Early Deployment Planning

- Define deployment requirements upfront
- Choose appropriate hosting platform
- Set up CI/CD pipelines

### 3.2 Staging Environment

- Maintain separate staging environment
- Perform thorough testing before production
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts

### 3.3 User Feedback Integration

- Deploy early prototypes
- Collect real user feedback
- Iterate based on usage patterns

## 4. Maintaining Security and Compliance

### 4.1 Security Best Practices

- Implement secure authentication
- Use encryption for sensitive data
- Follow OWASP guidelines

### 4.2 Compliance Strategy

- Identify relevant regulations
- Implement necessary controls
- Conduct regular audits

### 4.3 AI-Specific Security

- Validate all AI-generated code
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Use secure coding guidelines

## 5. Responsible AI Usage

### 5.1 Context Management

- Provide detailed context to LLMs
- Use domain-specific knowledge
- Maintain consistent coding standards

### 5.2 Verification Process

- Review all AI-generated code
- Use multiple LLMs for verification
- Maintain human oversight

### 5.3 Documentation Standards

- Document AI-generated code
- Track model versions and prompts
- Maintain change logs
